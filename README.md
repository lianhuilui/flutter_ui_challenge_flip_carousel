A fork of Matthew Carroll's Flutter Challenge: Card Flip Carousel

The only changes I made are:
1) To fix the "perspective problems" mentioned at the end of the video. This was fixed by setting an origin for the tranform.
2) I added a z value to the transform to make the card move away as they slide.
